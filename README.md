# BeefSense
Old ass version of the client, early 2021 I estimate. Probably much better now, only reason why it says "KiefSense" (kek) is because SmokeKief likes to rename the client :^). Hi ruupin and kief! <3

No hate to Ruupin and kief, I was just interested in having a look at this very old and crap version of the client.

Huge thanks to [REDACTED] for leaking the jar to me!
